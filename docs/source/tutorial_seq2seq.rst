Creating an Agent
=================
**Author**: Alexander Holden Miller

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up an agent which learns from the data it
sees to produce the right answers.

For this agent, we'll be implementing a simple GRU Seq2Seq agent based on
Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks (Sutskever et al. 2014) and
Sean Robertson's `Seq2Seq PyTorch tutorial <http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`_.


Part 1: Naming Things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to make programmatic importing easier, we use a simple naming scheme
for our models, so that on the command line we can just type "--model seq2seq"
("-m seq2seq") to load up the seq2seq model.

To this end, we create a folder under parlai/agents with the name seqseq, and
then put an empty ``__init__.py`` file there along with seq2seq.py.
Then, we name our agent "Seq2seqAgent".

The ParlAI argparser automatically tries to translate "--model seq2seq" to
"parlai.agents.seq2seq.seq2seq:Seq2seqAgent".
Underscores in the name become capitals in the class name: "--model local_human"
resides at "parlai.agents.local_human.local_human:LocalHumanAgent".

If you need to put a model at a different path, you can specify the full path
on the command line in the format above (with a colon in front of the class name).
For example, "--model parlai.agents.remote_agent.remote_agent:ParsedRemoteAgent".

Part 2: Main Agent Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First off, generally we should inherit from the Agent class in parlai.core.agents.
This provides us with some default implementations (often, ``pass``) of some utility
functions like "shutdown".

First let's focus on the primary functions to implement: ``__init__``, ``observe``, and ``act``.

The standard initialization parameters for agents are a dict of command-line
parameters ``opt`` and an optional dict of shared parameters called ``shared``.

For our Seq2Seq model we'll call our parent init method, which does a few basic operations
like setting self.observation to None and creating a deep copy of the `opt` dict.
Don't forget to pass the shared parameter to the parent init as well.

Then, we do a check to see if the `shared` parameter is set.
When it is not None, it's telling this instance to initialize with this particular
state, as this instance will be used either for batched or hogwild training
(depending on your preference).

A loose version of that implementation is this:

.. code-block:: python

    class Seq2seqAgent(Agent):

        def __init__(self, opt, shared=None):
            # initialize defaults first
            super().__init__(opt, shared)

            # ... some setup for both shared and original instances

            if not shared:
                # set up model from scratch
            else:
                # ... copy initialized data from shared table


To see more detail about sharing, batching, and hogwild in general, check out
:doc:`tutorial_worlds`.

We'll take a quick digression to describe how it applies to this agent.

Batching Example
----------------

Let's say we are training our seq2seq model on `babi:task10k:1`. What happens
behind the scenes for a batch size of 4 is that we actually create four shared
versions of the bAbI Task10k teacher, and four shared versions of the seq2seq
agent. These shared versions are initialized from the originals: for the bAbI
teachers, they inherit the data from their parent agent, but they each have
their own local state such as the current example they're showing or how far
through a bAbI episode they are (bAbI task 1 has five examples per episode).

For the seq2seq agent, each shared agent is keeping track of the previous
examples they've seen in this same episode, since each observation does not
repeat previously seen but related information--the agent has to remember it.
Note that this only applies when the ``batch-sort`` commandline parameter is
disabled (it's enabled by default), but since it can be useful to disable it
sometimes we'll go into more detail here.

For example, in the first entry in the episode the agent could get something like the following:
"John is in the bathroom. Mary is in the kitchen. Where is Mary?"
And in the second example in the episode, the agent could get:
"Mary picked up the milk. Mary went to the hallway. Where is John?"
Here, the answer is in the first example's context, so the agent had to remember
the previous text it saw within the same episode.

Observations are generated by calling the ``act`` function on each teacher, then
passing those observations to each agent by calling the ``observe`` function of the
shared agents. The agents are free to transform the previous observation
(for example, prepending previously seen text from the same episode, if applicable).
These transformed observations are packed into a list, which is then passed to
``batch_act`` function our agent implements. We can implement ``batch_act`` differently
from the simple ``act`` function to take advantage of the effects of batching
over multiple examples when executing or updating our model.

Thus, since our agent's shared-instances will only be used to keep track
of state particular to their sequence of examples in the batch, we have
barely anything to do when setting these shared instances up--they won't be
doing any intensive computation, just basic reading of the input.

The full initialization of the model is included further below, but is very
particular to this particular implementation. Let's talk more about the primary
agent functions we need to define first.

Observing and Acting
--------------------
Let's take a look at the ``observe`` function. Here, we can modify the
observation dict if necessary, and then return it to be queued for batching.

In this version, we first make a deep copy of the observation. Then, if this is
not the first entry in an episode (some datasets like SQuAD have only one entry
for every episode, but others like bAbI have multiple), then we prepend the
previous text to the current text. We use a newline to separate them in case the
model wants to recognize the difference between different lines.

Then, we store whether this is the last entry in the episode so that we'll be
ready to reset next time if we need to.

A simple version of this is shown here:

.. code-block:: python

    def observe(self, observation):
        observation = copy.deepcopy(observation)
        if not self.episode_done:
            # if the last example wasn't the end of an episode, then we need to
            # recall what was said in that example
            prev_dialogue = self.observation['text']
            observation['text'] = prev_dialogue + '\n' + observation['text']
        self.observation = observation
        self.episode_done = observation['episode_done']
        return observation

In the current implementation we use a utility function for more complex
processing, but this is a suitable first step.

Next up is the ``act`` function. Since we are going to implement a batched
version, we'll just call the batched version from our single-example act to
reduce code duplication.

.. code-block:: python

    def act(self):
        # call batch_act with this batch of one
        return self.batch_act([self.observation])[0]


Now it's time for the batch_act function. This function gets a list of length
batchsize of observations and returns a list of the same length with this
agent's replies.

We'll follow this loose format:

1. Set up our list of dicts to send back as replies, with the agent's ID set.

2. Convert the incoming observations into tensors to feed into our model.

3. Produce predictions on the input text using the model. If labels were available, update the model as well.

4. Unpack the predictions into the reply dicts and return them.

.. code-block:: python

    def batch_act(self, observations):
        batchsize = len(observations)
        # initialize a table of replies with this agent's id
        batch_reply = [{'id': self.getID()} for _ in range(batchsize)]

        # convert the observations into batches of inputs and targets
        # `labels` stores the true labels returned in the `ys` vector
        # `valid_inds` tells us the indices of all valid examples
        # e.g. for input [{}, {'text': 'hello'}, {}, {}], valid_inds is [1]
        # since the other three elements had no 'text' field
        xs, ys, labels, valid_inds, is_training = self.vectorize(observations)

        if xs is None:
            # no valid examples, just return empty responses
            return batch_reply

        predictions, text_cand_inds = self.predict(xs, ys, is_training)

        # maps returns predictions back to the right `valid_inds`
        # in the example above, a prediction `world` should reply to `hello`
        PaddingUtils.map_predictions(
            predictions.cpu().data, valid_inds, batch_reply, observations,
            self.dict, self.END_IDX, labels=labels,
            answers=self.answers, ys=ys.data if ys is not None else None)

        return batch_reply

Since the implementation of ``vectorize`` and ``predict`` are particular to our
model, we'll table those for now. Next up, we'll cover some of
the other methods in the Agent API.


Part 3: Extended Agent API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few other useful methods you may want to define in your agent to
take of additional functionality one might want during training. Many of these
functions will be automatically called if you use our example training function
to train your model.

share()
-------
Agents can use this method to share any information they might want between
different instances during batching or hogwild training. For example, during
hogwild training all models are being trained indepedently in multiple processes,
so you would want to share the model parameters between each one. Teacher classes
use this method to share their data and metrics with other shared intances.

If you define this method, it's usually a good idea to initialize the shared
dict that's begin return by calling super().share() first. For example, the
Teacher class in parlai.core.agents defines it this way:

.. code-block:: python

    def share(self):
        """In addition to default Agent shared parameters, share metrics."""
        shared = super().share()
        shared['metrics'] = self.metrics
        return shared

In our seq2seq model, we'll share a bunch of basic initial states.
Most of the implementation is shown here:

.. code-block:: python

    def share(self):
        """Share internal states between parent and child instances."""
        shared = super().share()
        shared['opt'] = self.opt
        shared['dict'] = self.dict

        if self.opt.get('numthreads', 1) > 1:
            # we're doing hogwild so share the model too
            if type(self.metrics) == dict:
                # move metrics and model to shared memory
                self.metrics = SharedTable(self.metrics)
                self.model.share_memory()
            shared['metrics'] = self.metrics
            shared['model'] = self.model

        return shared


shutdown()
----------
This function allows your model to do any final wrapup, such as writing any last
logging info, saving an end-state version of the model if desired, or closing
any open connections.

Our seq2seq model saves the model parameters to opt['model_file'] + '.shutdown_state'.
In contrast, the agents in parlai/agents/remote_agent use this to close their
open TCP connection after sending a shutdown signal through.

Most models won't need to do anything in particular here.


Part 4: Finishing the Seq2Seq model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we'll take a look at the full details of ``__init__``, ``vectorize``, ``predict``, and more.

Full __init__()
---------------

Here's full code to get an initialization of a model working.
We recommend storing model modules in a separate class and importing them
(and if you're using torch, extending nn.Module).
We'll show a version which defines its modules in the same file, since it's a simple model.

Note that we're showing the simple version from the PyTorch tutorial below.
The current seq2seq implementation in ParlAI adds a lot more bells and whistles.

.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    from torch import optim
    from torch.autograd import Variable

    from parlai.core.dict import DictionaryAgent
    from parlai.core.utils import maintain_dialog_history, PaddingUtils, round_sigfigs
    from parlai.core.thread_utils import SharedTable


    class EncoderRNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
            super(EncoderRNN, self).__init__()
            self.hidden_size = hidden_size

            self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, hidden_size)
            self.gru = nn.GRU(hidden_size, hidden_size)

        def forward(self, input, hidden):
            embedded = self.embedding(input).view(1, 1, -1)
            output = embedded
            output, hidden = self.gru(output, hidden)
            return output, hidden

        def initHidden(self):
            result = Variable(torch.zeros(1, 1, self.hidden_size))
            if use_cuda:
                return result.cuda()
            else:
                return result

    class DecoderRNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, hidden_size, output_size):
            super(DecoderRNN, self).__init__()
            self.hidden_size = hidden_size

            self.embedding = nn.Embedding(output_size, hidden_size)
            self.gru = nn.GRU(hidden_size, hidden_size)
            self.out = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
            self.softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)

        def forward(self, input, hidden):
            output = self.embedding(input).view(1, 1, -1)
            output = F.relu(output)
            output, hidden = self.gru(output, hidden)
            output = self.softmax(self.out(output[0]))
            return output, hidden

        def initHidden(self):
            result = Variable(torch.zeros(1, 1, self.hidden_size))
            if use_cuda:
                return result.cuda()
            else:
                return result

    class Seq2seqAgent(Agent):

        def __init__(self, opt, shared=None):
            # initialize defaults first
            super().__init__(opt, shared)

            # ... some setup for both shared and original instances
            self.metrics = {'loss': 0.0, 'num_tokens': 0}

            if opt.get('numthreads') > 1:
                torch.set_num_threads(1)

            if not shared:
                # set up model from scratch
                self.dict = DictionaryAgent(opt)
                self.id = 'Seq2Seq'

                # store important params directly
                self.longest_label = 1

                # set up modules
                self.criterion = nn.NLLLoss()

                hsz = opt['hiddensize']
                nl = opt['num_layers']
                # encoder captures the input text
                self.encoder = EncoderRNN(len(self.dict), hsz, nl)

                if self.use_cuda:
                    self.encoder.cuda()
                    self.decoder.cuda()

                # set up optims for each module
                lr = opt['learningrate']
                self.optims = {
                    'encoder': optim.SGD(self.encoder.parameters(), lr=lr),
                    'decoder': optim.SGD(self.decoder.parameters(), lr=lr),
                }
            else:
                # ... copy initialized data from shared table
                self.opt = shared['opt']
                self.dict = shared['dict']

                if 'model' in shared:
                    # hogwild shares model as well
                    self.model = shared['model']
                    self.metrics = shared['metrics']

            # we use START markers to start our output
            self.START_IDX = self.dict[self.dict.start_token]
            # we use END markers to end our output
            self.END_IDX = self.dict[self.dict.end_token]
            # get index of null token from dictionary (probably 0)
            self.NULL_IDX = self.dict[self.dict.null_token]

        def reset(self):
            """Reset observation and episode_done."""
            self.observation = None
            self.history.clear()
            self.reset_metrics()

vectorize()
-----------
The batchify function takes in a list of observations and turns them into
tensors to use with our model.

.. code-block:: python

    def batchify(self, observations):
        """Convert a list of observations into input & target tensors."""
        is_training = any(['labels' in obs for obs in observations])
        # utility function for padding text and returning lists of indices
        # parsed using the provided dictionary
        xs, ys, labels, valid_inds, _, _ = PaddingUtils.pad_text(
            observations, self.dict, end_idx=self.END_IDX,
            null_idx=self.NULL_IDX, dq=True, eval_labels=True,
            truncate=self.truncate)
        if xs is None:
            return None, None, None, None, None
        xs = torch.LongTensor(xs)
        if ys is not None:
            ys = torch.LongTensor(ys)
        if self.use_cuda:
            # copy to gpu
            self.xs.resize_(xs.size())
            self.xs.copy_(xs)
            xs = Variable(self.xs)
            if ys is not None:
                self.ys.resize_(ys.size())
                self.ys.copy_(ys)
                ys = Variable(self.ys)
        else:
            xs = Variable(xs)
            if ys is not None:
                ys = Variable(ys)

        return xs, ys, labels, valid_inds, is_training


predict()
---------
The predict function returns an output from our model. If the targets are
provided, then it also updates the model. The predictions will be biased in
this case, since we condition each token on the true label token, but we are
okay with that--it just improves training F1 scores.

.. code-block:: python

    def predict(self, xs, ys=None):
        """Produce a prediction from our model. Update the model using the
        targets if available.
        """

                # this produces a biased prediction but better training
                xes = self.lt(y).unsqueeze(0)
                for b in range(batchsize):

Finally, this function converts our hidden state (from the decoder) to specific
indices into our dictionary, allowing us to return tokens from the dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    def hidden_to_idx(self, hidden, drop=False):
        """Converts hidden state vectors into indices into the dictionary."""
        if hidden.size(0) > 1:
            raise RuntimeError('bad dimensions of tensor:', hidden)
        hidden = hidden.squeeze(0)
        scores = self.d2o(hidden)
        if drop:
            scores = self.dropout(scores)
        scores = self.softmax(scores)
        _max_score, idx = scores.max(1)
        return idx, scores

For other utility functions like loading from file, or to see any new features
that we may have added to the model such as attention over the input or ranking
candidates, check out the source code at parlai/agents/seq2seq.
